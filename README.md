# Flyaware - Jeremy Griffes

This app presents data from [AviationWeather.gov](https://aviationweather.gov/data/api/) to fullfil the Defense Unicorns take home assignment.

Will suggested that I should spend no more than 4 hours on it. I've spent about 6 hours on it. The app does not meet all of the objectives set out in the assignment. Here's a breakdown of what has been done and what has not:

## Completed

- Allow users to add and remove airports by ICAO code
- Display a list of saved airports with:
- Latest decoded METAR (including wind, visibility, ceiling, temp) -- *not all fields are displayed*
- Tapping an airport opens a detail screen with full METAR + TAF -- *not all fields are displayed*
- Follow MVVM + Clean Architecture principles:
    - Clearly separated Data, Domain, and Presentation layers
    - UseCases to encapsulate logic
- Use HILT for dependency injection
- Use Ktor for network requests and serialization
- Manage UI state with Kotlin Flow / StateFlow
- Modular code structure

## Not Completed

- Visual badge or color to indicate current flight rules (VFR/MVFR/IFR/LIFR)
- Show next 6â€“12 hours of forecast conditions (TAF summary acceptable)
- Background Data Refresh - this would have taken an additional hour; skipped.
- Unit tests
- Other bonus enhancements
